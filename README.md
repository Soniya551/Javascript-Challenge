# Javascript-Challenge
     Make an api request to fetch random jokes (url:
     https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke).
     ● Create an array to store the jokes.
     ● Call the api after every one second till there are a total of five different jokes stored in the
     array.
     ● Add another property to the object 'laughRate'. Whose value is equal to the number of
     words used in punchline.
     ● Sort the array in order of 'laughRate'.
